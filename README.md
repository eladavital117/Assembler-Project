# Assembler Project
This project is an implementation of an imaginary processor for MIPS language, it was the final assignment of the course "System Programming Laboratory" (20465) at the Open University of Israel. (grade: 89)

## Getting Started
Use makefile to compile like so:
```
>    make
```

Then input the assembly code files:
```
>    assembler file1.as file2.as, file3.as
```
The assembler will create 3 output files for each of the input files:
- Object file
- Entries file
- Externals file

Check [test files](https://github.com/eladavital117/Assembler-Project/tree/master/Assembler/test%20files) folder for examples
